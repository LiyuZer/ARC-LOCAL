One pattern is that no 1s appear in output; 8s are replaced by color which is the *minimum* absent value from the lower portion containing 1's.\n\n    # Actually, the color is:\n    #  - For cases where the last filled row containing any 8, the output color is 2/3/7 depending on row index.\n    #  - OR: The output color rotates as [7,3,2] across the samples.\n    # But this is not generalized yet. However, in all the outputs, the color that replaces 8 is the *lowest unused positive integer* in the input grid besides 1 & 0.\n\n    # For example, sample 1, input contains 0,1,8; output color is 7.\n    # Sample 2: 0,1,8     output: 3\n    # Sample 3: 0,1,8     output: 2\n    # Sample 4: 0,1,8     output: 3\n    # Sample 5: 0,1,8     output: 2\n    # So, possibly, for the lower group of 1's (the bottom-most group of nonzero entries), the output color is set to the minimum unused color.
