For each output row, pick the corresponding block and\n    # rotate the block upwards by the row index (mod 4).\n\n    # But more simply:\n    # By checking each sample, the output is formed by:\n    # For each output row r:\n    #   For each output column c:\n    #     output[r, c] = input[r, block_cols[c] + c]\n    # where block_cols = [block0_start, block1_start, block2_start, block3_start]\n    # block0_start=0, block1_start=5, block2_start=10, block3_start=undefined\n\n    # But sample outputs closely match corresponding per-row blocks per mapping.\n\n    # The actual ARC community solution is: Each output is the 4x4 sub-square block leading up to the next \"2\" column in the input!\n    # That is, find the three \"2\" columns (typically in the same positions for all input rows) as column indices,\n    # and extract the 4x4 block immediately preceding the last '2' column -- i.e., columns idx-4:idx for the last '2'.\n\n    # For all provided samples, the last \"2\" column is at index 9, so columns 5:9.\n\n    # Actually, in the first sample, the output is columns 0:4 (before col 4 which are all 2).\n    # In next, output is columns [0:4], in sample 3, columns 5:9, in sample 4, columns 10:14, etc.\n    # So best to look for the '2' columns and extract the previous 4 columns for each, and take the block that matches the output.\n\n    # But across all given samples, the logic is:\n    # - The 4x4 output grid is formed by extracting the 4x4 block that *most closely matches* the square in the input\n    #   that is left of and above a vertical all-2 column (i.e., right before a '2' column).\n    # Let's try to code that:\n\n    # Find all columns where every row is '2':\n    twos = np.where(np.all(input_grid == 2, axis=0))[0]\n\n    # For each block ending at each '2' column, \n    # extract the 4 columns before it.\n    candidates = []\n    for col in twos:\n        if col >= 4:\n            block = input_grid[:,col-4:col]\n            candidates.append((block, col-4, col))\n    # There may be a block at the rightmost end\n    if input_grid.shape[1] >= 4:\n        block = input_grid[:,-4:]\n        candidates.append((block, input_grid.shape[1]-4, input_grid.shape[1]))\n    # Now compare each candidate block to the output shape we expect.\n    # But in actual problem, from the sample we see that the correct output is always the block whose left edge is immediately before a '2' column, or the last four columns.\n\n    # The trick for ARC is to take the 4x4 block which contains the most non-zero elements (most filled/colored).\n    # But in all examples provided, the last block of 4 columns (columns 10-13 or 10:14) is always present.\n\n    # So, let's generalize:\n    # - Find all column indices where every row has a '2'\n    # - For each, extract the previous 4 columns as a candidate block.\n    # - Also extract the last 4 columns as a candidate\n    # - Of all 4x4 candidate blocks, select the one with maximum number of non-zero elements.\n    # -
