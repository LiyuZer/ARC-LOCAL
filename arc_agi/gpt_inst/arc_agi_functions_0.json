- fills the inner \"core\" of these intervals with a core color deduced from sample pattern\n\n    # By careful comparison, we can see:\n    # For each block type (border color), in the initial row it appears, \n    # the internal region gets a \"core\" color according to the block row's index (in kind of a diagonal pattern).\n    # This is a mapping (border color, vertical location in pattern) => core color.\n    # The pattern is: for the block with border color X, its core color on the next internal rows is the color of the border of the next block (from the left)\n    # - In example 1 (original), block at col 1..8 has border=1, row 2-3 core=4, row 5-6 core=9, row 13-14 core=3, row 17-18 core=6\n    # - in the transformed, these rows are filled in the corresponding ranges.\n\n    # Actually, analyzing diagonally, the core color always is the \"starting left color\" of the other block in the row!\n    # Let's try a different approach:\n    # For each block in a row, for each corresponding block in the next \"row-chunk\" (above and below), transplant that block's border color as the core color inside.\n\n    # Key pattern is: for each block (border), fill its inner region with the border color of the block at the same horizontal position in the next inner row-chunk.\n\n    # For each block, find its left and right.\n    # Then, in the core (excluding edges), fill with the border color from the block in the \"corresponding\" horizontal region in the counterpart block on the opposite chunk, or, shift from an internal pattern.\n\n    # After exploring the examples, in both, the mapping is:\n    # In rows where the block has a border, the 'core' of the block is filled (excluding the border) with a pattern matching the block content of that same offset in the next corresponding block.\n    #
