Equally, the zeros are allowed if they\n    are part of the pattern. \n    The quickest and most robust way to identify the output is to search for the densest rectangular region(s)\n    and, if necessary, compare row/col structures as in the output. However, in all examples so far, the output\n    rectangle is the *lowest/rightmost* non-background-looking block (in the sense of typical masking).\n    In addition, the output sizes (by example) are:\n        5x3, 6x8, 8x10\n\n    Upon checking, in all provided examples, the output region is the lowest block to the right/bottom,\n    i.e., the block in the bottom right area of the input grid.\n    So, to generalize: Given an input, find the smallest rectangle containing only rows and columns that have\n    more than X nonzero entries (mask threshold), and from the bottom area.\n\n    But in every example, it suffices to look for the dense, smallest block in the bottom/right regions.\n    This is essentially the same as finding the largest 'non-background' block in the bottom/right.\n\n    We'll attempt the block-find using a sliding window to find a block of the correct output shape (if known).\n    The output shapes are: (5,3), (6,8), (8,10).\n    However, as requested, the function should generalize for any input \u2192 output pair, so instead, we will \n    generalize by searching for the bottom-most rectangle of non-background pixels.\n\n    Let's use a mask: non-background pixels are those not equal to the most frequent value in the grid\n    (which is the background color, typically 0).\n\n    Approach:\n    - Find the most frequent value in the input grid (background).\n    - Create a binary mask of non-background pixels.\n    - For each block size in a reasonable range (from bottom right), check if there's a block with\n      a sufficiently high density of non-background pixels (or, just search for the largest contiguous block).\n    - Since in all examples, output is a minimal rectangle covering a dense non-background area, \n      just extract the minimal rectangle bounding all non-background pixels,\n      but only for rectangles of reasonable output size (not the entire grid).\n\n    This should generalize.\n\n    \"\"\"\n    import numpy as np\n    from collections import Counter\n\n    grid = input_grid\n    h, w = grid.shape\n\n    #
