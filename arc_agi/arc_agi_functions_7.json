Now, for special cases, the outputs show that isolated 3s mirror to opposite diagonals\n    # For row i, col j, if there's a 3, then go to (j, i) or (n-1-j, m-1-i) if symmetric\n    # Instead, generalize: for each group of 3s (block/cluster), find their bounding box,\n    # and place a block of 8s in the symmetric position on the grid\n\n    # Actually, let's just mimic example structure:\n    # - mirror 2x2 3-blocks to left most (and rightmost, if needed) columns on the same rows\n    # - mirror single diagonal 3s to relevant sides\n    # To do this correctly, let's use the exact pattern in the example.\n\n    # Here's a concise version that matches the examples:\n    # 1. For every 2x2 block of 3s, if it's on the left/top, put 8s on the leftmost column in the same rows\n    # 2. For every 1x1 (single) 3 or diagonal pair, mirror 8 to the opposite (perpendicular) border\n\n    # Let's clear and try again with a more structural approach:\n\n    # 1.

The 4 central columns (indices 2,3,4,5) seem to correspond to output columns for 8,0,4,5 regions\n    # The logic is as follows:\n    # - For each row, look at the 1st 5 columns (0-4) -> their unique pattern of 8's in the first 4 columns and 4 in col 4\n    # - For each row, make an output row; in output, a cell is 2 if there is an 8 somewhere at a certain input column location\n    #   and zero otherwise.\n    # But analysis of mapping:\n    # - For output, seems 4 columns\n    #   -- Let's inspect. For each output cell (i,j): which input columns correspond to a 2?\n    #   -- It's complicated - let's look for a pattern\n    \"\"\"\n    Based on detailed inspection, the output grid for each input row seems to be computed by:\n     \"For each of the four 2x2 blocks in columns [0,1],[2,3],[5,6],[7,8], \n      mark a 2 if the sum of those two input columns at this row is nonzero.\"\n    But this does not quite match up...\n    Let's try grouping as columns [0-1],[2-3],[6-7],[7-8] and so forth, but the mapping is for 4 output columns.\n\n    Let's try this: For output column k (k in 0,1,2,3), these correspond to input columns:\n    - 0: input columns 0-1\n    - 1: input columns 1-3\n    - 2: input columns 5-7\n    - 3: input columns 7-8\n\n    Actually, on examination, the output column j has a 2 iff there is an 8 in an associated input columns:\n    Let's generalize:\n\n    However, after more inspection, I believe the mapping is:\n    - For each output cell (i,j), if input_grid[i, j] == 8, then out[i, j] = 2\n    But output grid is only 4 columns wide.\n\n    After checking, it appears that for each row, for each contiguous block (of 2 columns) of input columns \n    0-1, 2-3, 6-7, 7-8 (offset by pattern), if any are 8, we mark a 2 at that output column.\n\n    But more simply, let's try this:\n    The output is a 5x4 grid, where \n    - For each row i, for each group of input columns [0,2,5,7], if there is an 8 at that column (sometimes only 5 columns used),\n      then output[i, j] = 2 at corresponding column, else 0.\n\n    The correct mapping appears to be:\n    output_col0 <-- any 8 at input_col0 or input_col1\n    output_col1 <-- any 8 at input_col1 or input_col2 or input_col3 (usually input_col2, col3)\n    output_col2 <-- any 8 at input_col5 or input_col6\n    output_col3 <-- any 8 at input_col7 or input_col8\n\n    Actually, after further reference:\n    Let's check this by making output_col[j] = 2 if input_grid[i, col_idxs[j]]==8, with col_idxs = [0,1,5,6], but that doesn't match.\n\n    Let's actually try: For each output column c in 0..3:\n        output[i,c] = 2 if any input_grid[i, col_idxs[c]] == 8\n    Let's set col_idxs = [[0,1], [1,2,3], [5,6], [7,8]]\n\n    But this may not always match, since in some rows 2's appear on output when no 8 is present.\n\n    However, THE KEY OBSERVATION: For each row,\n    - Output col0 is 2 if any input_grid[i,:3]==8   (columns 0,1,2)\n    - Output col1 is 2 if any input_grid[i,1:4]==8  (columns 1,2,3)\n    - Output col2 is 2 if any input_grid[i,5:8]==8  (columns 5,6,7)\n    - Output col3 is 2 if any input_grid[i,7:] ==8  (columns 7,8)\n\n    But in the outputs, sometimes 2 appears even if there is no 8 in that column group.\n\n    On closer look:\n    It appears, for each row:\n    - output_col0: if sum(input_grid[i,0:3] != 0) > 0, output[i,0]=2 else 0\n    - output_col1: if sum(input_grid[i,1:4] != 0) > 0, output[i,1]=2 else 0\n    - output_col2: if sum(input_grid[i,5:8] != 0) > 0, output[i,2]=2 else 0\n    - output_col3: if sum(input_grid[i,7:] != 0) > 0, output[i,3]=2 else 0\n\n    But in outputs, 2's only appear in some locations where there is a block of 8's or a block of 5's.\n\n    Re-examining all input/output:\n    It looks like the mapping is:\n      For each input_grid[i], if any value in [8,5] in slice input_grid[i,0:3], output[i,0]=2\n      If any value in [8,5] in input_grid[i,2:5], output[i,1]=2\n      If any value in [8,5] in input_grid[i,5:7], output[i,2]=2\n      If any value in [8,5] in input_grid[i,7:], output[i,3]=2\n\n    Actually, let's look at the output and input -
